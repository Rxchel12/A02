6. Save the link, we will use it in later steps.

- Git and Webstorm -

1. Download Git here: https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Download WebStorm here: https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/

5. In here we will paste our repo link that we save from part 1. (https://github.com/yourUCID/A02).
6. Save in a folder on your computer then click Clone, now we have our project in GitHub too.

- Modifications to README.md -

1. In WebStorm, open folder A02 and click README.md.
2. Write your information in this file and save it.
3. The file now is changed but Git hasn't saved it yet.
